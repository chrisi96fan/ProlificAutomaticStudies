# Firefox

This Firefox version currently lacks some features from the original Chrome extension, including the full extension interface functionality.

The main feature‚Äîgetting notified of new studies on the Prolific dashboard via tab name changes‚Äîworks most of the time, but it can be unreliable occasionally.


Installation

1. Under Releases, download ProlificAutomaticStudies_firefox.zip and save it to a location you prefer.

2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder.

3. Open Firefox and go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox.

4. Click the ‚ÄúAdd Temporary Extension‚Äù button.

5. Navigate to the extracted folder and select the manifest.json file.

Note: Since this is an experimental, temporary extension, you‚Äôll need to reload it every time Firefox restarts, and the notifications may not always trigger as expected.
